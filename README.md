## Description

I created my professional portfolio to showcase some of the projects I have worked on and to share my work with potential employers, other developers and colloborate on projects. This was built with React, Vite, Tailwind and awesome CSS. The motivation was to build a portfolio ready to share and to utilize my new React skills. The challenge was deciding what I wanted my portfolio to look like style wise and picking the projects to showcase. For future development, I link this portfolio to my domain name and add more projectsand improve upon it over time.
